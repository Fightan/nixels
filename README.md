# Nixels

This is a website I created to share information about myself and my work. I tried to make it visually interesting through the use of color, animation and three-dimensional effects.

The technologies I used - HTML, CSS, jQuery and Three.js - allowed me to create a more graphical design than a traditional resume website.

However, the main purpose remains clear and simple: to present my background, skills and experience in an accessible way for those who might want to get to know me professionally.

I've shared the source code publicly on GitHub in case anyone finds it useful as inspiration for their own website. The design is meant to engage the viewer first, but the content itself is most important.

If you have any feedback on how I could improve the website to serve its intended purpose better, please let me know. I appreciate you taking a look and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.
